# Anonymous Message Board
Here is a basic overview of how the anonymous message board app works:

- The user visits the website and sees a list of threads. Each thread has a title and a number of posts.
- The user can click on a thread to view the posts. Each post has a username (which is always "Anonymous"), a timestamp, and a body of text.
- The user can also create a new thread or reply to an existing post. To create a new thread, the user enters a title and a body of text. To reply to an existing post, the user enters a body of text.
- All posts are stored in a database. When a user creates a new post or replies to an existing post, the post is added to the database.
- When a user visits the website, the server retrieves the list of threads from the database and displays them to the user.
